# Password Generator
Simple one page HTML that can be hosted, saved locally or run as a bookmarklet. Uses sha512 to generate passwords up to 32 characters long. You can specify specific requirements, such as special characters.

It is an old project of mine, the code is not well organized, but someone might find it useful.

Inspired by the angel.net password generator.
Includes the sha512 implementation from Paj's Home: http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/sha512.html
